CLI to list all repos a user has access to, and report on their configuration in aggregate.

# Installation

- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- create `.env` file and initialize `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (in order of precedence) with your Github token

# Getting Started

## Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to [GitHub Tokens Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **Generate new token**.
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "my repo-report token").
4. Select the `repo` scope.
5. Generate the token and copy it.

---

## Using your PAT with Repo-Report

- You can set your token as an environment variable in your terminal:
- run `export GH_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token>`

OR you can add it to a .env file in the project root:
- run `GH_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token`


# Usage (for public)

- After you generated your PAT you can open terminal then do the following:
- on the terminal run `export GH_TOKEN=<the personal access token generated>`
- run `npx repo-report`

# Usage (for Contributors)

- execute `./bin/run` to get a report of all your repositories in the terminal

# Running Repo-Report with ``npx repo-report --help``

1. ``--help``
- Show all available flags and usage examples.

2. ``--unactionable``
- Shows metrics you can’t change

3. ``--actual``
- Shows raw values instead of a ✅ or ❌

4. ``--goodness``
- Shows if a metric is "good" (✅) or "bad" (❌)

5. ``-m, --metrics``
- Lists available metrics.

6. ``--all``
- Shows ALL metrics (Even ones that aren't actionable)

7. ``-p, --pick``
- Lets you select specific metrics

8. ``-f, --focus``
- Filters by repo type such as sources, forks, templates, private or public

9. ``--names``
- Shows repo names alongside their owners

10. ``-s, --sort``
- Sorts by "last updated date" by default; can be set to `name` or `created` instead.

11. ``-desc``
- Sorts descending instead of ascending.

11. ``--cache``
- Saves API request data in ``--cacheDir``.


# Optional (but helpful)
- If you would like an extended and more detailed view of your repos you can use:
- `npx repo-report --all --actual`
- If you would like to have this be the default view whenever you run repo-report, you can run with:
-  `alias repo-report='npx repo-report --all --actual`
- then run `source ~/.bashrc`

## Repo-Report Dashboard

The following shows an example output of repo-report --all --actual for my repositories. It shows important repository settings like issues, projects, branch protection, and allowed merge strategies. Additional details such as auto-merge, branch deletion on merge, and license information are also included in the full output as seen by the extended table below.
